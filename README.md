The following is the data pre-processing to build a predictive model to detect fradulent ATM transactions and possibly eliminate such transactions. 
The datasets available includes:

- Geo_scores- data regarding location of transaction
- Lambda_wts- proprietary index
- Qset_tats- network turn around times
- Instances_scores- vulnerability qualification score
- Train and Test Dataset containing masked variables

The prediction target is column 'Target' where-
- 1: Fraudulent transactions
- 0: Clean transactions
